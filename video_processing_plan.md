# Video Processing App: Requirements & Implementation Plan

## Requirements
- **Python** (for scripting)
- **ffmpeg** (with CUDA support, installed and in PATH)
- **Directory** to scan for video files (e.g., `.mp4` files)
- **JSON file** to log processing results

## Steps
1. **Scan a directory** for video files (e.g., `.mp4`).
2. For each file:
   - Run the ffmpeg command to create a processed output.
   - Check if the output file is smaller than the input.
   - Log the filename, processed status, and size difference to a JSON file.

## Implementation Plan
- Use Python's `os`, `subprocess`, and `json` modules.
- Store logs in a file like `process_log.json`.
- Make the script re-runnable: skip files already processed.

## Open Questions
- Should the script process only `.mp4` files or other formats as well?
- Should the directory be specified via command line or hardcoded?

## Updates
- The script will support all common video file types (e.g., `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.mov`, etc.).
- The directory to scan will be provided as a command-line argument.

## Additional Feature Ideas

- **Parallel Processing:** Speed up processing by running multiple ffmpeg jobs in parallel.

- **Custom Output Directory:** Allow specifying an output directory to keep originals and processed files separate.

- **File Extension Filtering:** Allow filtering by extension (e.g., --ext .mp4,.mkv).

- **Dry Run Mode:** Add a --dry-run option to show what would be processed/skipped/deleted without making changes.

- **Logging Improvements:** Add a log file for errors/warnings or support for more verbose/quiet output modes. ✅ **COMPLETED**
   
   **Implementation**:
   - Added comprehensive logging system with multiple log files
   - `processing.log`: Detailed log with timestamps and all processing information
   - `error_log.txt`: Dedicated error/warning log for quick problem identification
   - Added `--verbose` and `--quiet` command line options
   - Enhanced error handling with detailed ffmpeg output logging
   - Added processing timestamps to log entries
   - Improved error messages and debugging information
   
- **Progress Bar:** Show a progress bar for user feedback on large batches. ✅ **COMPLETED**
   
   **Implementation**:
   - Added optional progress bar using tqdm library
   - Shows current file being processed, completion percentage, and time estimates
   - Displays processing rate (files per second) and estimated time remaining
   - Graceful fallback when tqdm is not installed
   - Added `--progress` command line option
   - Enhanced log entries with processing duration timestamps
   - Progress bar updates for all file operations (processing, skipping, errors)

- **Config File Support:** Allow specifying options in a config file (YAML/JSON).

- **Post-Processing Actions:** Add hooks for post-processing, such as moving, renaming, or uploading processed files.

- **More Flexible ffmpeg Templates:** Allow users to specify a custom ffmpeg command template via a config or argument.

- **Cross-Platform Path Handling:** Ensure all path handling is robust for both Windows and Unix-like systems. ✅ **COMPLETED**
   
   **Implementation**:
   - Added comprehensive cross-platform path utilities using pathlib.Path
   - Implemented path normalization, validation, and relative path handling
   - Added platform detection and logging
   - Enhanced file operations with proper path resolution
   - Improved symlink and junction point handling
   - Added Unicode support for international characters
   - Updated all file operations to use cross-platform path handling
   - Added robust error handling for path-related operations

- **Graceful Interruption:** Support for safely stopping processing with Ctrl+C. ✅ **COMPLETED**
   
   **Implementation**:
   - Added signal handlers for SIGINT (Ctrl+C), SIGTERM, and SIGBREAK (Windows)
   - Implemented graceful shutdown that completes current file before stopping
   - Added proper cleanup of resources (progress bar, log files)
   - Enhanced summary output to indicate interrupted processing
   - Added appropriate exit codes for automation (130 for interrupt, 1 for errors, 0 for success)
   - Added clear user feedback during interruption process

- **Fix non 1080p Compatible Videos** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   Videos in a non 1080p aspect ration ie(mobile like)are being processed and look broken afterwards.
   We need to fix this, and potentially allow resizing/ reprocessing of them but maintainic their aspec ratio.
   
   **Implementation**: 
   - Updated CUDA encoder to use `scale_cuda=-2:1080` instead of `scale_cuda=1920:1080`
   - Added new 'smart' encoder option with letterboxing/pillarboxing for perfect 1920x1080 output
   - All encoders now maintain aspect ratio by default
   - Added comprehensive documentation in README.md
